Scene Folder 101

##################

Welcome to the scene folder! This is where you will test your features. 

When creating a new scene, keep in mind the following: 

1. Copy the default scene and use that as your starting point
2. Create your scene in Scenes/Features/_your_name_
3. Name your scene descriptively based on the feature you're working on.
If you like working on multiple features in the same scene, make sure you put
a comment in ClickUp about which scenes have which features.

If you have questions, please reach out to your systems officers!
