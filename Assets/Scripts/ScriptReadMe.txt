Scripts Folder 101

##################

Welcome to the script folder! This is where you will write code. 
We have a couple of different folders, so here's a brief description
of the most important:


## Fundamentals: 
These scripts are essential for the game. Oftentimes, mechanics will 
build off of these. 

## Fundamentals/Managers:
This folder contains scripts that should be in most every scene. 

## Mechanics: 
These scripts are what bring our game to life. Things like traps, npcs,
and complex actions will be created here. 

## Narrative:
This is the dedicated folder to narrative-related scripts. Stuff like 
dialogue will be created here. 

## Sound:
This is the dedicated folder for sound-related scripts. (may delete
later if we are using fmod)

## UI:
This folder contains scripts that manage the User input. (pause menu, 
buttons, main menu, etc)

When creating a new script, keep in mind the following: 

1. Has this script already been created for another feature? If so, 
can you use it for your current feature?
2. Keep your script names descriptive & as not repetitive as possible
3. Include comments so the documentation reader can record your code 
effectively

If you have questions, please reach out to your systems officers!
